The purpose of this small selection of code is to process side view videos of a single-leaf swaying around under hydrodynamic forcing to convert the leaf-motion into a line-representation for further analysis.   

To use the code please download the main file (.ipnb) and also the example video (.mp4), open as Jupyter notebook and run.
