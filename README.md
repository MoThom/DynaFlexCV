(Exploring the DYNAmics of a FLEXible submerged structure exposed to water flow, using Computer Vision)
by Moritz Thom 2018

A simple program to determine the dynamics of a single leaf exposed to fluid flow. Output is two textfiles (x.dat and y.dat) containing information about the leaf motion for further analysis.

## How to use
To use the code please download and run dynaflexcv.py.
